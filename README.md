# Open OnDemand Apps Deployed at Tufts HPC

These apps are configured specifically for the Tufts HPC environment. To migrate them to your own Open OnDemand (OOD) platform, you will need to update the appropriate fields to match your system setup.

To create your own nf-core OOD apps, you can use our custom script: [nf-ood-mod](https://github.com/TuftsRT/nf-core_open-ondemand).
